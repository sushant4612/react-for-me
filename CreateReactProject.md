## Vite

We can create react app by using `create-app` and `vite` 
command for that is following  
`npx create-react-app my-react-app`


Vite is a bundler or can be called as build tool for making project and manging them and it is lightweight as compare to the create-react app command because it doesn't add the script and testing files

`npm create vite@latest`

## Components
Components are the building blocks that allow you to create reusable and modular UI elements. Components can be thought of as custom, self-contained pieces of code that define how a part of the user interface should appear and behave.
