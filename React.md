# Reconciliation
Reconciliation in React refers to the process of updating the DOM (Document Object Model) to match the most recent virtual representation of a component's UI. In simpler terms, it's React's way of ensuring that the user interface reflects the current application state accurately.

# Virtual DOM
React JS Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the DOM. DOM refers to the Document Object Model that represents the content of XML or HTML documents as a tree structure so that the programs can be read, accessed and changed in the document structure, style, and content.
